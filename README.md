## Notes

Uses .NET Core, build with VS Code. No other external dependencies. To build/run, ensure you have .NET Core installed:

1. `donet restore`
2. `dotnet build`
3. `dotnet run`

I included four data sets from the challenge to make sure the code was truly working. You can toggle between them in the first line of the program.

Maths are hard.
