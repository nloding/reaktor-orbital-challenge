## Notes

Uses .NET Core, build with VS Code. No other external dependencies. To build/run:

1. Install .NET Core: https://dotnet.github.io/
2. `dotnet restore`
3. `dotnet build`
4. `dotnet run`

I included four data sets from the challenge to make sure the code was truly working. You can toggle between them in the first line of the program.

Maths are hard.
